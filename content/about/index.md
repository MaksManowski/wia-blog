# About Warwick in Africa

## What is Warwick in Africa?
Warwick in Africa is a programme which was established in 2006 by the University of Warwick. As part of this program, the University; sends student volunteers abroad; supports lead teachers; and provides teacher support.

In Warwick in Africa, we focus on two main subjects: Mathematics and English. We have found that focusing on these two subjects provides the best ‘bang for the buck’- these are powerful liberators from poverty and are vital for countries in Africa to reach their developmental goals.

Through the program, learners in Africa have gained access to a better quality of education and have gone to purse higher education or secure good jobs. Our impact extends far beyond the classroom too- we foster mutual respect between volunteers and local communities, creating lasting relationships which promote cultural exchanges and social progress.

## Our purpose
Our primary goal is to have a positive impact of the quality of education in our partner schools; both teaching quality and overall learning. We do this by facilitating student volunteer placements and providing a large range of training and supporting activities.
Student volunteers gain a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in another culture, experience life in the classroom, build personal resilience and a broad range of skills. They have so much to offer in terms of energy and enthusiasm, new ideas and a fresh perspective.
Learners enjoy an injection of new energy in their classroom and the company of young people from another culture. Furthermore, student volunteers often initiate new activities at the school during their placements which creates fresh experiences for learners. Overall, due to the support received by teachers and eagerness of student volunteers, learners benefit greatly making it likelier for them to succeed academically.

## Our history
The Warwick in Africa programme was started in 2006 as a charitable initiative intended to channel the talent of Warwick students and educational expertise into one primary aim; to promote and support education in sub-Saharan Africa.
The first year of the project saw just a few students travel to government schools in Africa to provide assistance in teaching English and Maths lessons. Recently we have extended our reach to 25 partner schools and send around 50 student volunteers to Africa each year!

## Why Warwick in Africa?
Only one in every four children of secondary school age attends school, and for those who do attend, getting a good education is still a huge challenge, let alone getting into higher education or getting a decent job. WiA has identified that maths and English are powerful liberators from poverty and vital in reaching developmental goals. WiA provides teacher coaches, student volunteer teachers and vital school resources to support and enrichen education in Africa.
Through the program's efforts, students have gained access to a better quality of education and have gone on to pursue higher education or secure good jobs. WiA's impact extends far beyond the classroom, as the program fosters mutual respect and understanding between volunteers and local communities, creating lasting relationships that promote cultural exchange and social progress.

## Our Values
Our four core values inspire and guide us through the programme. These are Collaboration, Respect, Aspiration, Impact, Commitment and Resilience. Each of these has their own proverb:

### Collaboration
> We identify and connect people with the ability to inspire and learn from one another, facilitating interactions intended to create the conditions for growth and change to take place.
### Respect
> Humility is a practice, not a state of being. When you practise humility you gain the respect of others.
### Aspiration
> The desire to inspire and give hope to others lies at the heart of everything we seek to achieve and it is something we wish for all those who engage with our programme.
### Impact
> We are driven by realising and maximising a genuine and sustainable impact from the full range of our activities.
### Resilience
> Resilience is the act of adapting well in the face of adversity, whatever that may be.
### Commitment
> We are proud of the legacy we have created with Warwick in Africa so far.
